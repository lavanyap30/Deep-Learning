# Melanoma Detection using Deep Learning

# Problem Statement - 
To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. 
It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has 
the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
- Among skin cancer diseases, melanoma is one of the most common and most dangerous ones, being difficult to detect and causing serious problems once spread deeper. 
Melanomas have many different shapes, sizes, and colours, thus making it harder to provide comprehensive warning signs. 
Detecting melanoma early is of utmost importance. Neural Networks provide significant progress in this field, making it possible to detect melanomas with many previously 
learned patterns, dealing with larger datasets than a human specialist can handle.

## Conclusions
-Skin cancer detection with artificial intelligence. We analysed different convolutional neural networks for melanoma detection to select the most accurate 
method for this purpose. In our solution, we used different base models with the same top layers to detect melanoma images from others images.
